## Solution
This challenge ask is requesting for what `An attempt to exploit a computer system or a private network inside a 
computer` is. That is `hacking`.
Since I didn't know whether the challenge was case-sensitive or not, I submitted it in upper case

> Flag: HACKIT{HACKING} 
 
NOTE: It was stated later during the challenge that the challenge was not case-sensitive, hence any submission
(so far as it is not misspelt) is correct.
